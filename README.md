# Introduction
This is an experimental **unfinished** Python library with the goal of being able to modify Brickadia prefabs and possibly generate them purely from outside the game.

I am working on this at my own pace and am unsure if the project will be finished.

# Current functionality
Can only unpack .brz files (see BRZ class). There is no documentation except for some docstrings.

# Requirements
+ Install the Python requirements in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) 
+ This was made using Pytthon 3.13.11 at the time

# Example
Run your Python interpreter as such, from the root of this project:
```bash
python -m brz
```
If you use a virtual environment, you may need to use a different path to the Python binary.

The `brz` module has example code in its [__main__.py](brz/__main__.py) source showing what it's capable of.

# Disclaimer
No warranty is provided for this codebase, and it is provided as-is. I won't teach how to use Python and I most likely won't add features when asked. Again, I am working on this at my own pace, and I don't know whether I'll finish it. Thank you for understanding.
